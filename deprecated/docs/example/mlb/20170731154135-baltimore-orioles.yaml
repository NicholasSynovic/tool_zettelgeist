summary: Baltimore Orioles
note: "The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore,\
  \ Maryland. The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the\
  \ American League (AL) East division. As one of the AL's original eight charter\
  \ franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise\
  \ spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee\
  \ Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns. After\
  \ 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the Browns franchise was purchased in\
  \ November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business interests led by attorney/civic\
  \ activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The franchise officially\
  \ moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season and began play in Memorial Stadium. The\
  \ Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland;\
  \ it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs\
  \ in Baltimore, including the 1901\u20131903 Orioles that would later move and become\
  \ the New York Yankees. Nicknames for the team include the 'O's' and the 'Birds'"
