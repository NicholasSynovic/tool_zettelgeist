Welcome to our project. We are still in the formative stages, especially when it comes to our web site. Luckily, it has become really easy to make
web sites for GitHub projects, simply by putting Markdown for your Jekyll site in the `/docs` folder. Whoa!

As we haven't really built a beautiful landing page, this post is aimed at helping you find items of interest.

- GitHub Repository: [zettelgeist-repo][zettelgeist-repo]
- Developer Mailing List: _coming soon_

If you are interested in our project, please join the mailing list when it becomes available. 
We will also have a list of projects on this site shortly.
