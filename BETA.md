These are some quick notes for the beta.

Beginning July 17, 2017, we will be placing emphasis on packaging and being able to "use" the tools, even as they are
being created.

Before beginnign a session, you should set up your environment variables. This is done by sourcing the `setpath.sh` 
script as follows:

```shell
cd zettelgeist
source setpath.sh
```

You can also put this in your `.bashrc` (or equivalent, e.g. .zshrc) if you wish to avoid re-running it each time you 
start a new terminal session, using your favorite text editor.

Once you have made these settings, you can run any of the ZettelGeist commands, e.g. `zcreate`, `zimport`, and the like.
Not all commands are available yet but will be soon.

To find out what commands are available, you can `ls zettelgeist/bin` to see what commands are available.
