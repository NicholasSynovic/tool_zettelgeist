What do you want to do?
-----------------------

-  Take research notes for a paper in order to be able to search them
   for … anything.

-  Follow the traditional (and ever-valid) methods of writing a note
   with a title, some keywords (tags), a note (with comment or summary
   if desired), and some bibliographical information (book or article
   title and page number[s]).

-  Find particular notes on particular themes and issues.

-  Send those particular notes to a file that will be the basis for a
   portion of your outline or draft.

All of these basic research, organization, and writing steps are steeped in traditional methods.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  As researchers and writers of papers, articles, books – from grade
   school, high school, college, graduate school, through our
   professional writings – as well as teachers and editors of countless
   efforts by others, we know the game. Indeed, we are the coaches and
   referees and main players of the game! And our own coaches taught us
   how to do it right!

-  On the basis of this experience, we made ZettelGeist to do the most
   important, fundamental steps of research and writing as clearly and
   directly as possible, based on the methods that our mentors used to
   write great books before personal computers came into being.

-  But because we are ourselves computerized (having come into
   professional life just as the pc revolution occurred and, therefore,
   having played *that game* ever since), we have here merged these
   techniques into the computer world more directly than any program has
   before. (Believe us: we know! We have tried and deployed every option
   out there, from 1980 until yesterday – as a matter of professional
   need.)

-  Since we know the frustration that many so-called “notetaking
   programs” cause, we have made a fundamental decision to ensure that
   the basis for all of this is already in the computer you own and the
   internet sites you have access to.

-  You don’t have to go and buy anything new. You already have
   *supercomputers* that earlier great writers could never have
   imagined. This system will just help you to take advantage of these
   machines in ways consistent with the key principles of research and
   organization that the great writers developed, but most computer
   programs have left out.

-  This is the Research-Writing-Computer Singularity we have been
   waiting for!

The first thing to know is that with ZettelGeist you can do ALL of the above by starting (and finishing) your writing with ANY SOFTWARE YOU WANT TO USE!! The ZettelGeist program works with and *between* your preferred word processors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Many programs suggest they are “app-gnostic” (agnostic or indifferent
   about which app you use), but that usually just means you can save
   your work into another format (docx, pdf, txt, etc.).

-  ZettelGeist is truly app neutral in the sense that you can make notes
   (zettels) with any software, as long as you make them according to a
   certain pattern (indicating note section, title section, etc…) and
   save or download them in good old “.txt” format.

-  The “pattern” is exactly what you would use to write out a notecard
   in the traditional way (by hand, or typed on paper or computer), so
   it really isn’t that big a deal. Plus, once you make one card (or
   zettel), you can just edit the same card to make any necessary
   changes for the next card (change the note, change the page numbers,
   etc.) then save the new card with a new filename, eg. “note02.txt”
   and move on…

-  You can do this with ANY word processor you want to use: Google Docs,
   Microsoft Word, LibreOffice. In fact, you could just use one of the
   most basic editors that are already residing on your computer, or
   easily installed for free: Notepad, Wordpad (on Windows), TextEdit
   (Mac), Vim, Emacs, etc.

-  If that last sentence confuses you, don’t worry. Just use Google Docs
   or Word or whatever you are used to. (The surprise is that you don’t
   actually have to buy any word processor at all because the above
   basic text editors come with your system and ZettelGeist would allow
   you to use those for free to research, organize, and write any great
   work you need to produce – but let’s set that issue aside for the
   moment.)

Let’s try it out with Microsoft Word.
-------------------------------------

-  As you can see on the “Get Started” and “Note Format” page above, a
   note in ZettelGeist is just a set of information put together in
   sections marked with a colon, like title: or note: or tags:, etc.

-  There are a number of those built into the system (see Note Format
   page) because, as researchers, we know you might also want to
   “comment:” or write a “summary:” or add bibliographical information
   such as “bibkey:” and “pages:”, and so on.

-  BUT this is completely up to you. You can add any of these elements,
   or only one or two, in any order according to your needs. A
   completely valid note would just start with “note:” and then just
   consist of the text of your note in the following line surrounded by
   quotations, including all the information you want to produce or
   record right there. That would work just fine. You could then save it
   as “note-01.txt” and it could be processed in ZettelGeist without a
   problem (after a minor change to the filename so it can be searched
   and used in the system – more on that in a minute).

-  If you want the other elements, like title: summary: or comment:
   great, just add them too. As long as you name sections according to
   the list on the “Note Format” page, or listed in “zettel –help”, you
   can create notes however you prefer, with sections in whatever order
   you like. Basically, you are making up your own notetaking system
   (based on these universally valid “fields”) and can treat any “file”
   as a blank notecard, just as you do when you buy a pack of 3 x 5
   notecards at the pharmacy and make flash cards for a high school
   class. Fill them out as you like!

So, with that flexibilty in mind, let’s make your first note.
-------------------------------------------------------------

For now, just go to Word, or GDocs (on the other tab)…your choice.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Start a new document.

-  Then take one step that will help with this experiment.

   -  Go to “Tools>Preferences>AutoCorrect” and **uncheck** most of the
      automatic styling elements. (This is based on the Mac version, but
      it should be about the same on the PC.)

      -  Uncheck “Capitalize first letter of sentences”

      -  Under “AutoFormat As You Type” uncheck “Automatic bulleted
         lists” and "“Straight quotes with smart quotes” and all the
         others.

   -  We want the simplest and plainest characters possible (most
      programs add fancier “unicode” characters with these features –
      but we don’t need them and they actually mess up searching and
      finding later).

   -  You can always turn these back on later, but you probably wouldn’t
      miss most of these anyway.

-  Close preferences and then just look at your plain document page. But
   now you can think of it a little differently. This is now a
   *notecard* (right out of your 3 x 5 package)! Even though it is on a
   supercomputer in the “cloud” linked to the internet, it is just a
   “card” now. Let’s just fill it in as we would by hand.

-  Let’s say you want to give it a title (remember, it’s up to you
   whether you need a title, but this will remind you what this field
   and other subsequent ones in this research session are about).

-  So, type:

``title: Reading notes on The Great Gatsby``

-  Ok. That’s the top line of your note, just like on the “red” line of
   your good old notecard.

-  Now, let’s put in something about the book you are reading, for
   instance (you could be taking notes for anything including your own
   novel or writing poetry or writing a shopping list, but we are
   thinking research paper for now).

-  Make a new line and type:

``note: "This is a note about The Great Gatsby, a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Written during The Jazz Age, it is a masterpiece of American Literature."``

-  Notice that I put the text part of this note: “inside quotation
   marks.” This is necessary when you write longer notes because it
   means you can put quotes and colons and multiple lines into your
   plain text card. Just a formality, but not a big deal. If you just
   write a single line without colons and other such things, you don’t
   need the quotes. But it works better with them if you are making
   notes this initial way with Word or another word processer.

-  For now, let’s just stop there and see what we can do with that very
   first note.

-  Let’s name the file, on Google Docs, by simply clicking in the file
   name box above (as usual – you know) and typing “Gatsby-Note”.

-  Now let’s save it so we can soon make it into a zettel for research
   processing.

-  Click File> Save As, then, under file format “Plain Text.txt.”

-  Then name the file “Gatsby-Note-1.yaml” and save it to a directory
   called “Gatsby-Reading-Notes” (for this project): “.yaml” is the
   “format” that the ZettelGeist system needs to work with.

-  If it asks about “text encoding,” select "Western (ASCII)

-  Immediately, it will save to your computer (into the directory set by
   your browser for downloads – usually Downloads).

But let’s make a couple of more notes (zettels) before we do any more.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-  All you need to do to make your next note(s) is edit your existing
   document! You don’t have to create a new one or anything. You already
   saved your first card, so it is safe. Now just edit your next one on
   the basis of this start, and save the new iteration as the next note.

-  We can leave title: the same… So no changes there.

-  Let’s change the note: (obviously). Just highlight from the first
   quotation mark to the last, delete the original note, and write
   another.

``note: "The novel opens with the lines 'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.' (Gatsby, 1)"``

-  We just added a quote from the book. So you might want to write
   something about that citation (your own opinion of its importance,
   etc.) as well. (Teachers want to hear your voice, and you want to
   remember why you took the note.)

-  That’s simple: You could just add something to the “note:” section
   itself:

``"The novel opens with the lines 'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.' (Gatsby, 1) Comment: This is a famous first line and my teacher says that we should analyze it carefully."``

-  See the “Comment” at the end? That would do it. As a result, you have
   title, note, citation-page (Gatsby, 1), and a comment (inside that
   last quotation mark). All the elements of a traditional notecard are
   there, just within the “note:” field. So let’s save that as a second
   note.

-  Just click “File>Save As” again. You don’t have to change settings
   again. Just change the name to “Gatsby-Note-2.yaml”.

-  Cool. Two notes are now in your research “card stack” for processing.
   If we did pull them into the system, they would be completely
   searchable and usable. Again: you could just take notes with “notes:”
   or “title:” and “note:” and that will do the job.

-  But, you can do a lot more if you want to. ZettelGeist allows you to
   break up these elements of research notes into each of the
   traditional elements listed on the “Note Format” page!

So let’s go back to our document and adjust this note to make a third with a little more…zing!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Highlight “Comment: This is a famous first line and my teacher says
   that we should analyze it carefully.” Then cut that (not delete).

-  Make a new line and paste it. Then make the capital “C” into a
   lowercase “c” and put your comment in quotations, resulting in:

``comment: This is a famous first line and my teacher says that we should analyze it carefully."``

-  You just set up a new “comment:” field that can be searched
   separately if you want. This is not necessary (as above) but it does
   allow you to separate, let’s say, the quotes you take from the source
   (in “note:”) and your ideas (in “comment:”). It’s up to you, but just
   in case you like it, it’s that easy to add more fields (per the “Note
   Format” page).

-  Now, let’s do something else that is key to research. Add “tags” to
   the note. This is another traditional part of any notecard system. It
   allows you to mark each note as being relevant to a theme or a
   keyword or a part of your paper (Intro, Body 1, Body 2, Conclusion,
   etc.). Adding tags is also really easy with the ZettelGeist method.

-  Continue with the existing document.

   -  (See? Making new “cards” just means editing and then re-saving
      your existing card in .yaml format with a new numbered name. Just
      give each new “save as” a different number: Gatsby-Note-01.yaml,
      Gatsby-Note-02.yaml, Gatsby-Note-03.yaml, etc. The existing
      elements just get reused over and over as you save every new
      version to your “stack.”)

-  To add tags, start a new line under the “comment:” line.

-  Type this:

::

   tags:
   - My first tag
   - Gatsby note
   - First line of book

-  Could it be simpler? Ha! “tags:” is the new section, just as above.
   But each tag is separate, so you just start the line for each tag
   with a hyphen to indicate this is the case. That’s all!!! (BTW: This
   is why we turned off “automatic lists,” because that feature would
   make those hyphens into bullet points. We just want clean hyphens.)

-  Let’s save that fancier note, just as above: “File>Save
   as>Gatsby-Note-03.yaml,” and so on.)

Your research stack is growing! Let’s do one more, adding one more feature. Again, it isn’t necessary, but “It’s there!” So what the heck?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Edit the document again.

-  Let’s find a new citation from the book and put it in the “note:”
   section (between quotes) and write a new “comment:” Just zap the old
   material and add the new, adjusting only what is necessary for the
   new note, resulting in something like:

::

   title: Reading notes on The Great Gatsby
   note: "Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart."
   comment: "In second paragraph, Fitzgerald begins to suggest Gatsby's cynicism and hints at fact that he was a veteran of the First World War"
   tags:
   - Gatsby note
   - Cynicism
   - Impact of WWI

-  You can also change the tags for this next note, as I did here.

-  Obviously, you could save this to the “stack,” go on to the next, and
   be fine.

-  But notice that this time (for demonstration purposes) I didn’t add
   an bibliographical indicator like “(Gatsby, 2)”. Most of us would
   just put that MLA element in and be fine. In fact, for 99% of users,
   that’s enough. Just keep track of which books you are using and add
   the notes or footnotes when you pull things together later. No
   problem.

-  But if you are into “bibtex” and plan to build your paper with zotero
   and pandoc (for more advanced users) you could also use this system
   to keep track of your bibliography. That just involves adding the
   following at the bottom:

::

   cite:
     bibkey: fitzgerald_gatsby_1925
     page: p. 2

-  That’s all. If you don’t know what “bibkey” means right now, don’t
   worry about it. (Just use MLA as above.) But if you do, you can add
   it and link this to your .bib file and when you build with pandoc all
   will be well. Just notice the spaces before bibkey: and page: Don’t
   use tabs to indent – put in two spaces.

-  Now let’s save this new card, as above.

-  OK! Now we have a “Stack” of cards in our “Gatsby-Reading-Notes”
   directory, each named “Gatsby-Note….txt” You could write a million
   more. Just change the elements that need to be changed and save the
   new version as a new card: copy or type out new quotes from your
   book; add comments; just write out notes; change tags; change
   page(s); change title if you want, etc.

   -  *Quick tip*: copying and pasting from electronic sources can be a
      little tricky because you don’t know about the “fancy characters”
      that will end up in your note. It’s best to just type out a quote
      (and paraphrase more than quoting, as the masters say). But if you
      do this, saving as plain text and Western (ASCII) should take care
      of it. Also make sure you are pasting things are inside those
      quotation marks). You might end up, after processing below, with
      some strange charcters like  in your
      notecards. They can be deleted, but are a little bit of a pain
      (and why plain text writing emphasizes plain text).

Let’s process our notes.
------------------------

-  Anyway, based on our start, let’s begin to process the notes we have
   made. (Just think about how you would start shuffling or organizing a
   stack of notecards you have written on paper.)

-  This is actually where the real power of this system starts.

   -  Remember, the idea is to make a notecard for every idea for your
      project, then be able to find them, select the ones you need, then
      print them out for your paper or for each section of your paper,
      according to themes or keywords or…

   -  This is waaaaaaay different from having all of your notes in a
      single document or having them on a few “Onenote” or “Evernote”
      pages, but then having difficulty selecting the particular cards
      or notes you need in particular. This is where the ZettelGeist
      system becomes an electronic version of “moving the cards around”
      when you start to outline or write the paper.

-  OK: you are ready to rock. Now you can do everything that is
   demonstrated with the “test” materials on the “Getting Started” page,
   but with your own research notes written in Word or GDocs or …

-  Everything from this point on assumes you have installed ZettelGeist
   and have your zenv environment working as explained on the
   Installation page.

-  This can be done right in the same directory you are working in.

-  First create a database name.

``zcreate --database gatsby.db``

-  Then import all of the new yaml notecards (or zettels) into your
   database.

``zimport --database --dir $(pwd)``

-  The output will show each of your notes being pulled into the
   database.

-  Once that is done, you are ready to start searching and organizing
   your notes.

-  Of course, with only a few it isn’t super exciting. But if you have
   taken notes on every thought you had when reading The Great Gatsby,
   the game would really be on!!

-  Let’s search for something in our stack. To do this, you use “zfind.”
   To see all the elements of zfind, you could type “zfind –help”. But
   we will keep things simple now.

-  Let’s search for the card that had to do with the First World War.

-  To do that, at the command line, type:

``zfind --database Gatsby.db --query-string 'comment:"First World War"' --show-title --show-note --show-comment``

-  When you enter this, the output will be the card that included the
   “string” First World War in the “commment:” field. See?

-  There are a zillion things to be done now that you have this
   searching ability. Again, it really comes into play when you have a
   bunch of notes and want to search on them. But this is the start.
   Let’s do one more.

``zfind --database Gatsby.db --query-string 'tags:"First Line"' --show-title --show-note --show-comment``

-  Take a look at what each of those commands is doing. ``zfind`` is
   starting the search engine. It is looking in the
   ``--database Gatsby.db``. It is searching for particular strings of
   letters in particular fields
   ``--query-string 'comment:"First World War"' and --query-string 'tags:"First line"'``.
   Then, for each card that has those elements, it is showing the title,
   showing the note, and showing the comment. That is what is showing up
   on the output.

-  The real power of zfind (searching in ZettelGeist) comes from
   combining these things (in as many ways as you want to use for your
   purposes). Here is an example. Let’s search for *both* of these
   elements in your cards: those with tags with First Line and those
   with commments with First World War. To do that, you just use the
   “or” command (the vertical bar created by [shift-backslash] in the
   query string, as in:

``zfind --database Gatsby.db --query-string 'tags:"First Line" | comment:"First World War"' --show-title --show-note --show-comment``

-  Hit enter, and both of those cards will flash by (or the parts you
   specified: title, note, and comment – though you could have asked for
   tags and cite and… any elements you include).

-  You have just searched and found the two notes that met those
   requirements. Not such a big deal out of 4 notes, but out of 100?
   That’s cool.

But, you want to use them for a portion of your paper on those themes, right?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  To do that, just add one more basic element into your search command:
   “> search-results.txt” That’s all you need. The “>” sign (like an
   arrow) means “send that output into a file” – as in, your results
   file… Or your Gatsby-results.txt file… Or your
   “Gatsby-Body-Part-1.txt” file, depending on how you want to arrange
   your information.

Let’s do the last one:

``zfind --database Gatsby.db --query-string 'tags:"First Line" | comment:"First World War"' --show-title --show-note --show-comment > Gatsby-Body-Part-1.txt``

-  Hit enter, and in an instant you will have a file with all the
   searched data under that name. Open Gatsby-Body-Part-1.txt with Word
   or any editor. It will have your notes on those issues all in one
   place for you to put into your paper document where you need it.

-  THAT’S how to use the *notecard* notetaking system to take notes,
   mark them for particular content, find them, collect them, and then
   pull them into your paper – all using the computer instead of paper
   notecards (not that there is anything wrong with paper notecards,
   they still rock, but we are digital writers now).

-  ZettelGeist has been made to make this great, traditional, powerful
   way to do research (on anything) or just write or just make lists or…
   as immediate as possible, but without trapping you in one word
   processing system OR trapping your notes (etc.) in a onenote system
   or an evernote system. (Nerd joke: EverNote keeps your notes,
   forever: like a black hole, once the information goes in, it never
   comes out.) ZettelGeist allows you to put your material in (according
   to some classic rules) and then GET IT OUT in the bits and pieces
   that you actually need.

-  The zfind feature can be modified in many ways to get more
   “fine-tuned” material from your electronic card stack(s). Also, you
   can break things up into the various fields we have discussed. BUT,
   again, you could also just take notes as “note:” and be fine,
   including whatever you need in that field alone (in quotations to be
   sure there aren’t processing issues) and then search for strings in
   all the “notes” sections. It can be that simple, or as complex or
   professional as you want. It is completely up to you.

-  It is as flexible as paper notecards were, but as powerful as any
   supercomputers are. That’s what we are talking about!!!!

In conclusion, for Word (etc.) users…
-------------------------------------

**Your notetaking system is still there, ready and waiting for you to
continue with your project! Just take a look back at the Word document
you were working on – the master “card” is ever-ready for you to edit
and “save as” your next idea, and your next, and … (Fractals, baby!!)**
