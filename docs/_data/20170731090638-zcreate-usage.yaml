summary: Creating a database
note: |-
  The ZDB (Zettel DataBase) is used for indexing of zettels.
  Indexing is needed whenever we wish to do deeper analysis of zettels, such as searching (using zfind).

  You can create an index at any time, and you can be selective about what files you're indexing (say, in a subdirectory). Just keep in mind that an index can easily become out-of-date, thereby requiring regeneration.

  $ zcreate --database zettelgeist.db
  Creating new database zettelgeist.db

  This results in an empty database being created.
